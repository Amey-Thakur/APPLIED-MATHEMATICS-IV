     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Applied Mathematics IV (CSC401) is a core subject in the Second Year (Semester IV) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. This course deepens the mathematical foundations required for advanced engineering analysis, focusing on statistics, probability, and advanced algebraic concepts.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key mathematical domains:

- **Mathematical Expectations and Probability**: Probability theory, random variables, and expectations
- **Probability Distributions**: Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distributions
- **Sampling Theory**: Large sample tests, small sample tests (t-distribution, chi-square distribution), and hypothesis testing
- **Correlation and Regression**: Linear correlation and regression analysis
- **Calculus of Variations**: Variational problems and Euler-Lagrange equations
- **Linear Algebra (Matrices)**: Matrix operations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that mathematical foundations remain essential for solving complex engineering problems. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental mathematical concepts
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Applied Mathematics IV
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
